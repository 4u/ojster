# TODO

* extend readme.md

* write usage for bin/ojster
* add template examples

* ensure ojster can be used with jQuery and other libraries, at least skipping module-related stuff (without maintaining compatibility with Node and Closure)
* fs watcher for autocompilation (needs some kind of config - which src and dst paths to use, which options)
* perform JS-linting after template compilation

* make Tokenizer extendable (allow to add new commands)

* fix single file compilation support for path_compiler (works partially)

## GoogRenderer

* make usage of goog.scope an option
* fix handling of module subObjects (prohibited now)
