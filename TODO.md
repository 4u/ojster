# TODO

* use renamed `this` within blocks to allow override it _(e.g. within closures)_
* make stricter string trimming by default _(do not try to insert separating spaces)_
* fix a bug causing requirement of fragment at beginning of template file
* make usage of goog.scope an option _(GoogRenderer specific)_
* create separated Renderer which can be used instead of templates' static `render` method because we possibly will need more static methods and don't want to expand compiler each time we want to add more

* fix possible collisions problem with auto-requiring default base class and other such things


* add "autogenerated by ojster" warning to generated files
* parametrized blocks
* dynamic inheritance (skins support) - allow to choose which template to inherit in runtime

* fix problem with path to ojster/lib/template (?)

* finalize readme.md

* write usage for bin/ojster (within the script)
* add template examples

* ensure ojster can be used with jQuery and other libraries, at least skipping module-related stuff (without maintaining compatibility with Node and Closure)
* fs watcher for autocompilation (needs some kind of config - which src and dst paths to use, which options)
* perform JS-linting after template compilation

* make Tokenizer extendable (allow to add new commands)

* fix single file compilation support for path_compiler (works partially)

* provide a way to render template directly to stream (for node.js templates), also a way to render to stream of other template (for cases when one template renders other as part of itself)

## GoogRenderer

* fix handling of module subObjects (prohibited now)
* move all goog-related stuff from default generator to GoogGenerator
